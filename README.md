# Bug Shooter (sdl-space-shooter)

Simple Space Shooter made in SDL2 with ECS. 

This project is a take on the classic Space Shooter genre. You take on the role of an AI that fixes bugs inside a computer by firing 1s and 0s at the bugs; however, you must avoid getting hit by the dangerous bugs yourself.
